      <h3 class="bmt">bodybuilding and muscle training</h3>
      <p class="p2">I started training my muscles when i was about 16 years old.i only aimed to be as larger as possible,but i only got the increament in the power
      as i always focused to build it as natural as possible.i didn't taken protien yet.well its a real process so patience is the key.
    if you want to know about my routine, workout, and many more you can simply follow me on instagram where i'm gonna put a link in my bio about my workout routine and more.
  bodybuilding is a categorized sport. well i really like the powerlifting category. i aim towards a shredded powerlifter in future.</p>

    <p class="p3">As you all know bodybuilding and wed developing are totally diffrent from each other.so how these two are a skill of a single person.well,it's a part
     of my education, so definitely needed to be learned for the refrence.i'm persuing my course of software engineering.it was a little bit dream of mine
    to learn coding in childhood, as i wanted to develop my own game. later on things got diffrent, and then got back to the track. now i'm managing
   both muscle training as well as coding. as you can see the feed you are reading now, or the page you have got opened is designed by me. so i know a little lot more about this feel also.so if you need any info regarding it like the roadmap to web developing, i'll add the link about this also.</p>
